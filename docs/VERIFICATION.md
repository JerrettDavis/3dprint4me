# Release Verification

## Delivered result

**Status: local source verification PASS; live launch verification pending**

This record describes local source verification for the `3dprint4.me` release package. The current suite passed with the customer-facing privacy and terms copy. It does not establish that production DNS, credentials, private storage, email delivery, or checkout work on the live domain.

## Environment

| Component | Version used |
|---|---|
| Node.js | 22.22.0 |
| Python | 3.13.13 |
| Chromium | 151.0.7922.34 |
| Test runner | Node built-in test runner and pytest through Playwright |

The project runtime has no third-party npm dependencies. Playwright, pytest, and Pillow are development-only Python dependencies.

## What the verification covers

### Static and deployment structure

- Every intended public route is present.
- Local assets referenced by HTML resolve inside `public/`.
- JavaScript parses successfully.
- Vercel publishes only `public/`; functions remain in `api/`.
- API functions have a 45-second execution cap to accommodate successive bounded provider calls.
- The inline JSON-LD script has a matching CSP hash.
- The production social image is a 1200×630 PNG.
- `smoke:live` checks deployed routes, configured intake flags, security headers, and private-source denial without sending customer data.

### API and integration boundaries

- A real local HTTP server serves the public routes and security headers.
- Request creation and completion execute through the actual Node handlers.
- Invalid request data and unsupported content types are rejected.
- Generated production request IDs include 80 bits of random entropy.
- Upload metadata cannot escape its own request namespace.
- Supabase draft requests cannot be completed twice.
- Supabase signed upload and download URLs use the Storage API root.
- Signed file URLs are rejected if their host, object path, or upload token does not match the configured private Storage request.
- The browser sends signed file uploads using the expected `FormData` shape.
- Provider failures, including non-JSON error bodies, are normalized safely.
- A failed customer receipt does not cause a successful owner email intake to be reported as undelivered.
- Provider error bodies are excluded from server logs and browser errors.
- Provider network exceptions cannot put credential-bearing URLs into API or webhook failure logs.
- Optional integrations fail closed when they are not configured.
- A Stripe success return URL does not claim that payment was verified.
- Stripe checkout requires a signed proof from a live completed request; changing the customer invalidates it.
- A server-side HTTP 4xx keeps the intake editable, and an undelivered local copy cannot offer deposit checkout.
- A create-time server failure produces a local email/download handoff without trying to complete its local reference through the API.
- Delivery-only confirmations and customer receipts tell the customer to attach selected files separately because no private upload occurred.
- All four service submissions keep unrelated service fields and the empty file input out of `specifications`.
- Browser storage failure keeps live confirmations and local email/download handoff usable, with an editing warning.
- Shared page and theme controls initialize even when browser storage is denied from first paint.
- Blank print slicer fields use the selected size assumption, rather than near-zero weight and time.

### Browser, responsive, and accessibility behavior

- All eight routes render in desktop light and mobile dark profiles.
- Navigation, theme controls, conditional form sections, quote updates, inline errors, review state, file metadata, draft persistence, JSON export, and local fallback are exercised.
- Landmarks, heading order, image alternatives, accessible control names, new-window safety, focus visibility, responsive overflow, minimum target sizing, reduced motion, and measurable WCAG AA contrast are checked.
- The signed Supabase upload path is exercised in Chromium without exposing server credentials.

The detailed machine-readable and human-readable browser audit is in [`UX-AUDIT.md`](UX-AUDIT.md) and [`ux-audit.json`](ux-audit.json).

## Browser-harness note

The verification host had an enterprise Chromium policy that blocked navigation to all URLs, including loopback. Browser rendering tests therefore load the exact production HTML, CSS, SVG, and JavaScript into a controlled origin. This does not replace HTTP coverage: a separate E2E scenario starts the actual Node server and exercises routes, headers, validation, request lifecycle, local persistence, 404 behavior, and unconfigured integration paths over real HTTP.

## Manual launch gates

Automated verification cannot validate credentials or business policy. Before accepting paid work, complete these checks against the real deployment:

As checked on 2026-09-13, the apex domain resolved to `192.64.119.53`, outside Vercel's documented general-purpose apex address, and direct HTTPS checks of `/` and `/api/health` timed out. `www` resolved to `0.0.0.0` and `::`. Mail DNS has Namecheap forwarding MX records and SPF for that service, but no `_dmarc` TXT record; DNS does not prove that `hello@3dprint4.me` forwards to a monitored inbox. This workspace has no linked Vercel project or CLI credentials, so the exact project-specific DNS record and deployment state remain unverified. The verified source is pushed to the private `JerrettDavis/3dprint4me` GitHub repository on `main`. GitHub Actions [Verify run 34774131252](https://github.com/JerrettDavis/3dprint4me/actions/runs/34774131252) passed on the pushed source, including tests, audit, screenshots, and artifact upload. Inspect the domain in the Vercel project, update DNS to the value Vercel supplies, then rerun the live smoke test before sharing the domain.

The read-only `npm run smoke:live` check currently fails at the domain with 0 of 15 HTTP responses received; all route requests timed out. This is a live launch failure, not a local source-test failure.

1. Run the Supabase migration and confirm the bucket is private.
2. Submit a request with real test files and confirm the database row, object paths, and signed-link expiry.
3. Verify Resend domain authentication, inbox delivery, Reply-To behavior, and DMARC alignment.
4. Exercise Stripe in test mode and add a verified Stripe webhook before payment status controls fulfillment.
5. Test the production domain on desktop and mobile with keyboard and at least one screen reader.
6. Review pricing, taxes, shipping, retention, warranty, insurance, prohibited work, and legal copy for the actual business.
7. Configure rate limiting or bot protection before broad promotion if request abuse becomes material.

No live provider account, DNS record, production credential, or payment webhook is included in the source package.
